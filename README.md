[![CI](https://github.com/querwurzel/BinPastes/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/querwurzel/BinPastes/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

My turn on creating a simple pastebin.

## Features

## Requirements

* JDK 21+
* MySQL 8+

Just put the [JDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=any&arch=any&package=jdk&version=21) somewhere on your file system.
The `bin` folder contains the `java` binary.

### How to configure

For productive use with __MySQL__ copy `application-mysql.properties` and configure it according to your infrastructure. Make sure to place it next to the `binpastes.jar` binary before run.

- [application-mysql.properties](https://github.com/querwurzel/BinPastes/blob/main/backend/src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties)
  - mysql.host
  - mysql.database (default: `binpastes`)
  - mysql.username
  - mysql.password

### How to build

For productive use with __MySQL__ run:

```console
./mvnw clean package -Denv=mysql # results in backend/build/binpastes.jar
```

### How to run

For productive use with __MySQL__ run:

```console
java -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql -jar binpastes.jar
```

## Credits

I'd like to thank the creator of the original [PasteBin](https://github.com/lordelph/pastebin) in general and the authors of [sticky-notes](https://github.com/sayakb/sticky-notes) and [Paste](https://github.com/jordansamuel/PASTE)
in particular for their work and efforts in crafting FOSS pastebins for self-hosting.
I used and enjoyed your tools for quite some years, I even maintained them running on newer PHP versions for as long as I could.
