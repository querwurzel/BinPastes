# BinPastes
[![Java CI](https://github.com/querwurzel/BinPastes/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/querwurzel/BinPastes/actions/workflows/main.yml)

My turn on creating a simple pastebin.

## Features

* overview of notes / full-text search
* expiry of notes after some time (or never if desired)
* adjustable visibility of notes (exposure) 
* client-side encryption of content
* easy setup, single binary
    * zero knowledge required about the build tools, frameworks or programming language I chose

## Requirements

* JDK 17+
* MySQL 8+

Just put the [JDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) somewhere on your file system.
The `bin` folder contains the `java` binary.

## Credits

I'd like to thank the creator of the original [PasteBin](https://github.com/lordelph/pastebin) in general and the authors of [sticky-notes](https://github.com/sayakb/sticky-notes) and [Paste](https://github.com/jordansamuel/PASTE)
in particular for their work and efforts in crafting FOSS pastebins for self-hosting.
I used and enjoyed your tools for quite some years, I even maintained them running on newer PHP versions for as long as I could.
